### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Lidar-based localization noise often exhibits heavy-tailed or non-Gaussian behaviors.  
**Core contribution**: Modeling non-Gaussian noise as GMM and deriving a rigorous Chi-squared test.  
**Achieved goal**: Reliable fault detection in EKF-based Lidar/IMU systems.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: High-precision sensors like LiDAR have complex, non-Gaussian noise characteristics.  
**Problem created**: Conventional Gaussian assumptions lead to poor fault detection performance.  
**Why current solutions fail**: They lack the statistical framework to handle multimodal or heavy-tailed noise.

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Models noise as GMM and propagates it through EKF to establish residual distribution.  
**Contribution 2**: Transforms the GMM residual to approximate a standard multivariate normal for testing.  
**Key result**: 30% improvement in detection rate and 17-23% reduction in detection delay.

🎯 **Takeaway**: Rigorous GMM error propagation enables standard Chi-squared tests to work for non-Gaussian systems.
