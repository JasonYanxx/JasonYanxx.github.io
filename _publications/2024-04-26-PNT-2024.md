### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Developing error bounds for heavy-tailed DGNSS error distributions.  
**Core contribution**: A partitioning strategy based on the convexity of BGMM tail membership weights.  
**Achieved goal**: A theoretically sound, unimodal, and symmetric overbound.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: Integrity monitoring requires rigorous proof that bounds hold after convolution.  
**Problem created**: Arbitrary overbounds may lose their bounding property when combined.  
**Why current solutions fail**: They often lack the structural properties (unimodality, symmetry) needed for convolution.

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Analyzes the membership weight of the tail component in a Bimodal GMM.  
**Contribution 2**: Proves convexity and uses it to partition the distribution into core and tail.  
**Key result**: Constructed a bound that is preserved through convolution, facilitating integrity monitoring.

🎯 **Takeaway**: Understanding the geometry of GMM weights allows for tighter, safer error bounds.
