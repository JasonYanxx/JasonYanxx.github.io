### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Mainstream fault detection relies on Gaussian assumptions, which fail in real-world non-Gaussian environments.  
**Core contribution**: A "jackknife detector" based on cross-validation without restrictive distribution assumptions.  
**Achieved goal**: Superior fault detection performance and reliability under non-Gaussian noises.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: Real-world GNSS errors in urban areas are often heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian.  
**Problem created**: Gaussian-based methods underestimate risk, while existing non-Gaussian methods lack rigorous guarantees.  
**Why current solutions fail**: They are either unreliable (Gaussian assumption) or computationally expensive (MHSS).

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Proposes a test statistic based on the jackknife technique (linear combination of measurement errors).  
**Contribution 2**: Constructs a hypothesis test with Bonferroni correction for robust fault detection.  
**Key result**: Detected a real-world satellite clock anomaly 8 minutes earlier than the MHSS method.

🎯 **Takeaway**: A distribution-free, statistically rigorous fault detector that outperforms traditional methods in non-Gaussian reality.
