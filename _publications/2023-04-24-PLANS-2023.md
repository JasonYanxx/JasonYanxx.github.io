### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Sensor-based localization (e.g., visual positioning) fails in extreme conditions.  
**Core contribution**: A sensor-free localization method using online System Identification (SI).  
**Achieved goal**: Extended navigation capability without collisions during sensor outages.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: Autonomous systems require continuous availability even when sensors fail.  
**Problem created**: Conventional Vehicle Dynamic Models (VDM) drift too fast to be useful backups.  
**Why current solutions fail**: They lack real-time adaptation to the vehicle's actual dynamics.

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Identifies system dynamics of powertrain and steering online.  
**Contribution 2**: Uses identified responses to drive the VDM for positioning.  
**Key result**: Successfully navigated a 140-meter trajectory without collision during a complete sensor failure.

🎯 **Takeaway**: Online system identification turns the vehicle model into a reliable backup navigator.
