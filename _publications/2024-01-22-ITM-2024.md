### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Detecting faulty measurements in EKF-based systems under non-Gaussian nominal error.  
**Core contribution**: A fault detection method using GMM noise modeling and a transformed test statistic.  
**Achieved goal**: Improved sensitivity to small and slowly increasing faults.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: Sensor noise in complex environments is rarely Gaussian.  
**Problem created**: Gaussian-based detectors miss subtle faults or react too slowly.  
**Why current solutions fail**: Mismatch between the assumed (Gaussian) and actual (GMM) noise distribution.

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Models LiDAR range noise as GMM and proves the EKF measurement residual is also GMM.  
**Contribution 2**: Derived a transformation using the law of total covariance to standardize GMM residuals for chi-squared testing.  
**Key result**: Demonstrated superiority in detecting small faults compared to Gaussian methods.

🎯 **Takeaway**: Accurate noise modeling is the key to sensitive fault detection.
