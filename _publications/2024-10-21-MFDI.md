### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Deletion-based greedy search algorithms suffer from "swamping" (wrongly excluding healthy measurements).  
**Core contribution**: An incrementally expanding algorithm starting from a minimum fault-free basic set.  
**Achieved goal**: Reduced swamping rate and improved post-isolation positioning accuracy.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: Multi-constellation GNSS increases the probability of multiple simultaneous faults.  
**Problem created**: Aggressive exclusion by greedy search degrades satellite geometry and accuracy.  
**Why current solutions fail**: They prioritize fault removal over preserving healthy measurements, leading to geometry loss.

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Constructs a minimum basic subset based on the smallest studentized residuals.  
**Contribution 2**: Incrementally expands the set using jackknife residuals and no-fault hypothesis testing.  
**Key result**: 50% reduction in swamping rate and 38% reduction in mean post-isolation positioning error.

🎯 **Takeaway**: Don't just delete faults; incrementally build a healthy set to preserve geometry and accuracy.

99.5% percentile of post-isolation positioning error over the course of the day by (a) the incrementally expanding algorithm and (b) the deletion-based greedy search algorithm in isolating multiple faults (six simultaneous faults, 20m, two constellation).
