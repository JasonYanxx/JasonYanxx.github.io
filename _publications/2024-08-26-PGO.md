### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Heavy-tailed errors in urban GNSS ruin integrity monitoring if not properly bounded.  
**Core contribution**: Principal Gaussian Overbound (PGO) utilizing Bimodal Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM).  
**Achieved goal**: A tight, safe, and convolution-preserving overbound for integrity.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: Urban navigation requires strict integrity, but errors are heavy-tailed.  
**Problem created**: Single-Gaussian bounds must be hugely inflated to cover tails, destroying availability.  
**Why current solutions fail**: They are either too loose (conservative) or lack theoretical guarantees for convolution.

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Proposed an conservative yet sharp non-Gaussian overbound method (PGO) and mathematically proved its overbounding property is preserved through convolution.  
**Contribution 2**: Formalized the calculation of Protection Levels (PLs) using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to significantly accelerate computation.  
**Key result**: Reduced mean Vertical Protection Level (VPL) by over 50% compared to the two-step Gaussian method.

🎯 **Takeaway**: A smarter way to bound heavy tails that keeps protection levels low and integrity availability high.
