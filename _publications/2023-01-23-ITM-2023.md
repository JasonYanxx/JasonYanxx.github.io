### 1) What problem is this paper solving?
**Context**: Vehicle Dynamic Model (VDM) simplifications and environmental assumptions limit positioning accuracy in Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs).  
**Core contribution**: Utilizing endogenous information (System Identification) to improve VDM.  
**Achieved goal**: Bridging the gap between system identification and navigation in AMRs.

### 2) Why is this paper important?
**What changed**: AMRs need to operate reliably without heavy reliance on external corrections.  
**Problem created**: Simple physical models don't capture complex real-world dynamics.  
**Why current solutions fail**: They treat the vehicle model as static and known, which is rarely true.

### 3) How does this paper solve it?
**Contribution 1**: Conducts a system identification process to identify plant dynamics.  
**Contribution 2**: Integrates identified dynamics into the VDM development.  
**Key result**: Better positioning and navigation performance than conventional VDM.

🎯 **Takeaway**: Endogenous information is a powerful, underused resource for autonomous navigation.
